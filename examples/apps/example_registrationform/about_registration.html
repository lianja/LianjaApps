<h3>Users and Roles</h3>
Each <b>user</b> that you add to Lianja can be granted one or more named roles e.g. manager. 
When you create an App you can assign permissions at the App, Page, Section and Field level. 
Alternatively you can create roles dynamically and assign these roles on a per user basis.  
The <b>Attributes</b> dialog for each element e.g. Pages has options to set its permissions. 
The permissions you specify are a comma separated list of roles for that element. 
Individual permissions can be specified for Create, Read, Update and Delete operations. 
For example, if you only want to grant access to a certain page in your App to managers, 
then create a role called <b>manager</b> and specify it in the <b>Read</b> permissions for the page. 
This will prevent the page from being viewable (and it will not be available in the sidebar menus) 
for any user who does not have the <b>manager</b> role. 
<br><br>
To restrict access to individual Apps, assign roles to the App in its settings attributes dialog. 
Lianja provides the ability for you to restrict access down to the level of the fields which appear 
in form sections. Individual sections within pages can also be hidden based on the roles that a user belongs to. 
Additionally, you can prevent unauthorized users from updating and/or deleting records that are displayed.
